+# Game Name

## Elevator Pitch

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*

## Influences (Brief)

- *Influence #1*:
  - This Is The Only Level (game)
  - Explanation: While thinking through game ideas, I was drawn to games I enjoyed growing up, something I used to play. This game is a platformer in which you complete puzzles. I thought and interesting way to present these learning objectives would be working through puzzles in a way similar to that game.
- *Influence #2*:
  - LightBot (game)
  - Explanation: This game essentially teaches functional decomposition in reverse. The game limits the amount of commands that you can give to the robot(with the goal of having him reach the light bulb). Some levels are impossible to complete if you do not combine commands into groups and use these groups multiple times(for loops).
- *Influence #3*:
  - Medium: IDES
  - Explanation: We hope to design the game to at least have a similar feel to that of an IDE, or something similar to that

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- Platforming
  - Using arrow keys (or WASD) to navigae through the levels and using spacebar to jump
- Puzzles
  - Tasks emulating the theme of coding ideas, such as for loops
- Power-ups / pick-ups
  -Aspects of the level changing for the level for the benefit of the player

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

*Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.*

## Target Audiences

Those in k-12 playing these games during computer lab to gain interest in computer science, as well as those in college struggling with certain ideas in programming

## Target Contexts

K-12 computer labs during free time, high school labs during free time, possibly college 

## Learning Objectives



- *Short Name*: By the end of the game, players will be able to predict the behavior of a for loop in the context of the game, and match the in-game components to components of a real coding for loop
- *Short Name*: By the end of the game, players will be able to predict the behavior of a for while loop in the context of the game, and match the in-game components to components of a real coding for loop
- *Short Name*: By the end of the game, players will be able to identify whether a variable is global or local

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- Participants should have knowledge of highschool level math
- Participants would have a much easier time with basic programming knowledge

## Assessment Measures

- Pre game, participants will be assessed through a quiz that we have made
- Post game, participants will be assessed through a similar quiz that we have made

# What sets this project apart?

- This game presents a visual representation of programming logic that is underutilized or poorly executed upon when trying to introduce coding concepts to new learners. The player engages in a fun game to later have the game mechanics equated to programming components, which generally results in better retention.
- Not many games growing up involve any sort of programming, or major logic puzzles, so children are introduced to these concepts at an earlier age, and can become interested in the field
- Students in early computer labs class tend to play games on coolmathgames.com, or adventuregames.com etc, and could come into contact with this game instead

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

You begin in a level selector, where each level is a few lines of code representing a function. Most of these levels will be locked and can only become unlocked through completing a previous level. Each level is a function which is used in an overarching Main function. You play as a variable in an array of variables, traversing each function through platforming and puzzles. Your final goal is to complete each level in the fastest amount of time with the most points.

## Player Modes

- Single player mode: Play through mode, where the player is able to play through the game like normal, completeing puzzles and platforming.

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Primary Objective #1*:
    - Description: Finish the level
    - Alignment: Finishing the level will allow the player to progress the game, reaching new functions and learning more
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: Complete puzzles
    - Alignment: These puzzles introduce concepts of coding compontents. For example, 
- *Primary Objective #3*

# Procedures/Actions

- left -> left movement
- right -> right movement
- up -> jump action
- down -> crouch action?
- e -> use/interact with action
- r -> possible shoot action


# Rules

- 3 Lives to begin with
- Ability to find more lives around the game
- Pick up power ups to help progress through levels

# Objects/Entities

- Levels
- Enemy -> running into these enemies moving around will cause you to lose a life and reset your level

## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

*The Summary or TL;DR version of below*

## Storyboarding

https://imgur.com/a/qI00Al2
*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
